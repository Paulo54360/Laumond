        "Titre": "Unmanifest Statement* of MetaHism",
        "Texte": "Today, in our materialistic society, of hyper individualism, man is dehumanized and, paradoxically, the cultofthe ego continues to take precedence over our personal development and therefore over our evolution towards a search for universal meaning. The genesis of MetaHism finds its origin in this reflection. It has been necessary for me to define myself as making art rather than being an artist. Although this is often understood as being a corollary to the act of creation, it seems to me that it is not the artist who determines the art, but the art which on the contrary determines the artist.",
        "Texte2": "This approach guided my personal research journey and led me to create MetaHism. This art of consciousness has matured throughout thirty years of experimentation, reflection and readings that are as transversal as they are a priori antagonistic (from the quantum scientific thesis to philosophy and spirituality). From a plastic point of view, I have experienced everything. I always ended up confronting myself with the limits of what already existed in art, a mirror effect, reducing the evolution of my own consciousness and of what I had to say. Thus, I never stopped and I never stop trying to transcend the existing, by transcribing a new complex thought.",
        "Texte3": "The artist has always had the vocation of responding to orders and calls for tenders. Today, in our society of consumerism, he seeks to create buzz and must be an entrepreneur converted to merchandising, which can have the perverse effect of limiting his own freedom of thought and creation.",
        "Texte4.1":"MetaHism is an exploration.",
        "Texte4.2":"MetaHism is a material support for understanding the object of consciousness through art.",
        "Texte4.3":"MetaHism is a materialization of the fundamentals of consciousness in its entirety applied to art ; what I call the fundamental consciousness of the whole.",
        "Texte5": "Today, in our society of dematerialization, all mediums have been exploited (painting, sculpture, installation, video...) and everything can be art (the manufactured object, the consumer product, the concept, the artist himself...).",
        "Texte6.1":"MetaHism is not a criticism of art but a new form of artistic consciousness that encompasses, merges all the dimensions of art.",
        "Texte6.2":"MetaHism gives new meaning to art by creating a new form of language that is multidimensional and whose words can be declined ad infinitum in the dialogic form of matches.",
        "Texte7":"Today, in our society, all thought must be determined, stopped, objectified without leaving any room for uncertainty and indeterminism.",
        "Texte8.1":"MetaHism proposes to unify these opposites, to connect them",
        "Texte8.2":"MetaHism proposes to synthesize systemic thinking in its most dual and complex aspect. ",
        "Texte8.3":"MetaHism is a holistic conception of art.",
        "Texte9":"Today, in our society, man is constantly running after time and would like to have the gift of ubiquity. Social networks and the internet are a symptomatic manifestation of this.",
        "Texte10.1":"MetaHism proposes to demonstrate that two distinct entities, despite their spatial distance, can continue to dialogue together. The connection is possible despite the space- time. ",
        "Texte10.2":"MetaHism demonstrates the illusion of space-time.",
        "Texte10.3":"MetaHism is a meditative invitation to the here and now.",
        "Texte11":"Similarly, the notion of anthropocentrism would be an illusion of our place in the Universe. At a time of upheaval of ecosystems, Man cannot deny that he is only the tiny element of a great Whole of which he is a part.",
        "Texte12.1":"MetaHism is a Holographic work. Each volume serves the whole. The whole is more than the sum of the parts, the part is in the whole, but the whole is in the part. The most common example is that of the genetic heritage of an individual that is found in each cell that composes it. ",
        "Texte12.2":"MetaHism invites us to go beyond any form of individualism. .",
        "Texte12.3":"MetaHism invites the spectator to be an actor. He is observed and observer at the same time. It becomes a constituent element of the work.",
        "Texte12.4":"MetaHism invites us to open up to the fields of all possibilities. ",
        "Texte12.5":"MetaHism invites us to reconnect with each other and by extension to the great whole.",
        "Texte12.6":"MetaHism invites us to connect antagonisms ; consciousness and unconsciousness, materiality and immateriality, the visible and the invisible, the temporel and the timeless, interiority and exteriority, the limit and the infinite or the continuous and discontinuous.",
        "Texte12.7":"MetaHism is part of a change of era of which it is the transcription.",
        "Texte13":"'Méta, because expressing the whole, ism as a concept and universal suffix, which is found in all movements and H, eighth letter of the alphabet, (infinity letter, 00, lemniscate) and separator. Letter to high symbolic significance. Cerebral and sensitive, virtual and real, painting, sculpture, concept, installation, LAUMOND's work is all of this and more. resulting from an approach of absolute rigor, its. This work remains the most radical manifestation of a free spirit'",
